# DevOps & Infrastructure Overview

## Overview
This section covers DevOps practices, infrastructure management, and deployment strategies. It provides guidance on automating software delivery, managing infrastructure as code, and implementing continuous integration and deployment pipelines for reliable and efficient software delivery.

## Key Areas
- **Containerization**: Docker and container orchestration technologies
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Managing infrastructure through code
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated build, test, and deployment processes
- **Cloud Platforms**: Working with various cloud providers
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Tracking system health and performance
- **Security**: DevSecOps practices and security automation
