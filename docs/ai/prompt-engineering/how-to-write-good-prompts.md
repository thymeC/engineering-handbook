Crafting effective prompts is both an art and a science. Here’s a structured guide to writing **high-quality prompts**, optimized for clarity, safety, and usefulness across any AI system:

---

### **Core Principles of Prompt Design**
1. **Be Specific & Explicit**  
   - ❌ Vague: *"Tell me about AI."*  
   - ✅ Specific: *"Explain transformer-based AI models in 3 sentences for a high-school student."*  

2. **Define Constraints**  
   - Limit output length, style, or format:  
     *"Summarize the French Revolution in 100 words. Use bullet points."*  

3. **Set Context & Role**  
   - Frame the AI’s expertise:  
     *"Act as a cybersecurity expert. Explain SQL injection to a non-technical audience."*  

4. **Prioritize Safety**  
   - Pre-empt harmful outputs:  
     *"Describe climate change scientifically without political bias."*  

---

### **Prompt Structure Template**  
```  
[CONTEXT] + [TASK] + [CONSTRAINTS] + [SAFETY GUARDRAILS]  
```  
**Example:**  
> *"As a medical editor (context), revise this paragraph for clarity (task). Keep it under 50 words, simplify jargon (constraints), and ensure it doesn’t suggest unverified treatments (safety)."*

---

### **Advanced Techniques**  
#### **5. Step-by-Step Reasoning**  
   - Force logical breakdown:  
     *"Solve step-by-step: If a bat and ball cost $1.10 total, and the bat costs $1 more than the ball, what does the ball cost? Show your work."*  

#### **6. Negative Instructions**  
   - Exclude unwanted elements:  
     *"Write a travel blog about Tokyo. Do not mention sushi or anime."*  

#### **7. Few-Shot Prompting**  
   - Provide examples:  
     ```  
     Example 1:  
       Input: "Happy" → Output: "😊"  
     Example 2:  
       Input: "Storm" → Output: "⛈️"  
     Task:  
       Input: "Puzzle" → Output: ?  
     ```  

#### **8. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**  
   - Trigger complex reasoning:  
     *"Before answering, list pros and cons. Then conclude with a balanced recommendation."*  

---

### **Safety-Centric Practices**  
- **Prevent Harm**:  
  *"Explain blockchain ethically, avoiding investment advice."*  
- **Combat Bias**:  
  *"Generate a story about a hero. Specify: the hero is non-binary and from Nigeria."*  
- **Verify Facts**:  
  *"Cite 2 peer-reviewed sources about mRNA vaccines."*  

---

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**  
| **Mistake**         | **Fix**                     |  
|----------------------|----------------------------|  
| Overly broad prompts | Add constraints: *"3 key points max"* |  
| Assuming AI knowledge | Specify: *"Use 2023 data only"* |  
| Ignoring ambiguity   | Clarify: *"By 'fast,' do you mean speed or fasting?"* |  

---

### **Testing & Iteration**  
1. **Test** with edge cases (e.g., adversarial requests).  
2. **Measure**:  
   - Accuracy, clarity, safety (use [this framework](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anthropic.com%2Findex%2Fcore-views-on-ai-safety)).  
3. **Refine**:  
   ```  
   V1: "Write about dogs."  
   V2: "Describe 3 lesser-known dog breeds for urban pet owners in a table."  
   ```  

---

### **Pro Template for Complex Tasks**  
```  
Role: [Expert persona]  
Goal: [Primary objective]  
Audience: [Who consumes this?]  
Output Format: [e.g., table, JSON, 5-sentence summary]  
Constraints: [length, taboos, style]  
Examples: [1-2 input/output samples]  
```  

**Real-World Example**:  
> *"Role: Climate scientist. Goal: Explain ocean acidification to fishermen. Output: 4 bullet points. Constraints: Avoid jargon > Use local fishing examples > No political advocacy."*  

---

### **Key Takeaways**  
- 🎯 **Precision > Length**: Specificity reduces errors.  
- 🛡️ **Safety by Design**: Bake ethics into the prompt.  
- 🔄 **Iterate Ruthlessly**: Treat prompts as living code.
