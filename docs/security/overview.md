# Security Overview

## Overview
This section covers comprehensive security practices and principles for software development and deployment. It provides guidance on implementing security measures at every stage of the development lifecycle, from design to deployment, ensuring applications are secure, compliant, and resilient to threats.

## Key Areas
- **Application Security**: Securing applications throughout the development lifecycle
- **Infrastructure Security**: Protecting infrastructure and deployment environments
- **Data Security**: Ensuring data protection and privacy
- **Identity & Access Management**: Managing user authentication and authorization
- **Security Testing**: Comprehensive security testing strategies
- **Compliance**: Meeting regulatory and compliance requirements
