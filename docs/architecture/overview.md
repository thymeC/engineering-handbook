# Architecture Overview

## Overview
This section covers software architecture principles, design patterns, and architectural decision-making processes. It provides guidance on creating scalable, maintainable, and robust system architectures that align with business requirements and technical constraints.

## Key Areas
- **Design Patterns**: Proven solutions to common architectural problems
- **System Design**: Principles for designing large-scale systems
- **Architecture Decision Records**: Documenting architectural decisions
- **Scalability**: Patterns for building scalable systems
- **Maintainability**: Ensuring long-term system maintainability
